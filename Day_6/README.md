# Day 6 - Reeborg's World Maze Solver 

This project involved solving logic-based maze and hurdle challenges using Python functions inside Reeborg’s World on Day 6 of 100 Days of Python.
 
---

## What It Does

The robot (Reeborg) had to navigate obstacles and reach the goal using algorithmic thinking.

---

## Topics Covered

- Custom Python functions (`def turn_right`) to simulate missing functionality
- While loops (`while not at_goal`, `while front_is_clear`) for continuous pathfinding
- Conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to decide movement
- Sensor-based decision making (`front_is_clear()`, `right_is_clear()`, `at_goal()`)
- Boolean logic with `not`, and compound condition checking

---

## Challenges Attempted

- ✅ Hurdle 1
- ✅ Hurdle 2
- ✅ Hurdle 3
- ✅ Hurdle 4 
- ❌ Maze (needed solution help)

## Learnings
This was the most challenging day yet. It taught me to break problems into steps and apply logic through control flow and loops. Even though I struggled with the Maze, analyzing the solutions helped me understand how to think like a programmer.

## Try It Yourself

You can test this maze-solving logic on [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html)  
Set the world to "Maze" or any of the Hurdles and give it a try and paste the code in the editor.
